Verlet Integration
==================

This netbeans project is based entirely out of leveraging Java native libraries to make use of the light weight verlet integration and simulate realistic motion. This is demonstrated in the Verlet.java file, where connectors and the natural motion are used in unison with gravity to give a "realistic" 2d cloth simulation, though not totally bug-free.

**Controls**

Mouse click on a vertex in the cloth simulation and drag it anywhere.

Click and hit spacebar to pin/unpin a selected vertex (pinned vertices don't move, so your guess is as good as mine when you've selected)
