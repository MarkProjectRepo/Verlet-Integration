Verlet-Integration
==================

This project is based entirely out of leveraging Java native libraries to make use of the light weight verlet integration and simulate realistic motion. This is demonstrated in the Verlet.java file, where connectors and the natural motion are used in unison with gravity to give a "realistic" 2d cloth simulation, though not totally bug-free.
